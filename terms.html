				<h1 style="margin-top: 140px; ;">Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
				<p><br>
					Khalsa Camp reserves the right to cancel a booking/registration without reason. In the event of a cancellation by Khalsa Camp, Khalsa Camp will only provide a refund for any fees paid during the registration process to the Camper.<br>

					Campers tell us Khalsa Camp is&nbsp;well organised, exciting, and in the words of past campers, “a life changing&nbsp;experience.” We want it to be an awesome memorable experience not just for you and me, but for everyone attending, visiting. To ensure Khalsa&nbsp;Camp runs smoothly&nbsp;we ask everyone (campers, sevadars, site workers, and anyone else) we ask you to stick to a few of rules which are basic common sense.<br>
					<br>
					Campers must not possess, use or distribute/sell any intoxicants including tobacco and alcohol.<br>
					<br>
					Any area of the camp site which is gender-designated i.e. female/male only; should be abided by. Males must not enter female only areas and vice-versa.<br>
					<br>
					Any offensive, abusive behaviour towards anyone including fellow campers, volunteers or site personnel will not be tolerated and such campers will be expelled from Khalsa&nbsp;Camp.<br>
					<br>
					No pets/animals are allowed.<br>
					<br>
					Campers must be 16+ unless written agreement has been provided by Khalsa Camp before booking is made.<br>
					<br>
					Mobile phones must be switched off during certain camp activities.<br>
					<br>
					Any deliberate damage to any equipment, security systems, health &amp; safety precautionary equipment etc. will lead to immediate expulsion from Khalsa&nbsp;Camp and liability for payment for any damage caused for the offender.<br>
					<br>
					Any visitors i.e. parents/guardian are welcome to visit with prior agreement with the Administration Coordinator at Khalsa Camp. The length of stay will be the day, no accommodation will be provided for the visitor and the visitors will be charged at the rate of £99 per day&nbsp;per person.<br>

					<br>
					No persons may enter or leave the camp site without prior permission for safety reasons.<br>
					<br>
					The use of aerosol deodorants is prohibited as they can set off fire/smoke detectors. If there is a false alarm due to disobeying this, the responsible party will be fined by the camp site.<br>
